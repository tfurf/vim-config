This is largely a fork of [derekwyatt's vim-config](https://github.com/derekwyatt/vim-config).

I usually install this to fresh machines with 

```
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/tfurf/vim-config .vim`
$ cd .vim
$ ./install.sh
```

As per usual, it's provided without any express guarantee of anything. It's a hack of a bunch of things I've read in various places, and is probably even self-inconsistent.
